2. Create a Branch

After cloning the repository, create a new branch for your work. It‚Äôs best practice to create a branch for each feature or bug fix you‚Äôre working on.

git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

Or for bug fixes:

git checkout -b bugfix/issue-number

3. Make Your Changes

Work on your changes in your branch. Make sure to follow the code style and conventions used in the project.
